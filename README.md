# Classic Pigmen

This texture pack is ment for the pig creatures in the Nether to evoke the aesthetic of the old nether but with modern textures. In my opinion the current hoglins do not fit the original style of minecraft. Why are thier heads rectangles???

Requires Optifine to work. currently not complete.

For 1.20.5
